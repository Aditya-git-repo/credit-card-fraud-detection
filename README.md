# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest classifier, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the vast amount of transactions processed daily, itâ€™s crucial to have robust and accurate methods to identify and prevent fraud.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

- **Number of Transactions:** 284,807
- **Number of Fraudulent Transactions:** 492
- **Features:** 30, including `Time`, `Amount`, and anonymized variables `V1` to `V28`

## Models Used
- **Random Forest Classifier:** A robust ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Installation
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
